You have to manage urllib.error.HTTPError exceptions and
-print: Error code: followed by the HTTP status code
You must use the packages urllib and sys
You are not allowed to import other packages than urllib and sys
You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
You must use the with statement
